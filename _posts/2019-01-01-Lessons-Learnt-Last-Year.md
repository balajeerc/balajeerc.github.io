The following will be a short post, introspecting on the lessons learnt over the past year.

## Lesson 1: Typesafety is Indispensable
 
 I'll probably write a longer post on this, but long story short, am never picking a language without compile time typesafety if I have a choice.

## Lesson 2: Learn to Stop Worrying and Love SQL

I should probably reword this as: stop bothering with ORMs and love SQL.
