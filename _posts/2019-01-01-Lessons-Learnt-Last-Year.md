The following will be a short post, introspecting on the lessons learnt over the past year.

## Lesson 1: Typesafety is Indispensable
 
 I'll probably write a longer post on this, but long story short, am never picking a language without compile time typesafety if I have a choice.

## Lesson 2: Learn to Stop Worrying and Love SQL

I should probably reword this as: stop bothering with ORMs and love SQL.
I have always hated SQL since I found the grammar very ugly. I hated it because it wasn't composable. I hated it because it just had too many primitives to hold in your head.
I don't anymore.
Stuff that hangs around, and dominate for over a couple of decades need to have some merit.
Once you get over the initial repulsion and start grokking it, the power it brings you is magnificent. 
Having a decent SQL IDE(?) like DBeaver also helps.

## Lesson 3: VSCode

I have always relied on vim to do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to code editing. I used to stub my nose at people
