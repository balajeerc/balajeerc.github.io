__NOTE: Am not currently looking for opportunities__

- Diverse experience in various domains: most recently, Fintech (worked on all levels of the stack)
- Love to code, trade derivatives, and code. (Like to code so nice, I say it twice).
- Decent at a Poker table. Decent at Options trading. It ain't gambling if you can count cards.
- Functional Programming Zealot. I chew up OOP design patterns for breakfast and spit out far more elegant functional equivalents.

- Stack I reach for immediately are: Postgres, Python/NodeJS, ReactJS, Redux, Redux-Saga
