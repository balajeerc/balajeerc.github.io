(This is a quick informal introduction. If you are a headhunter who prefers neatly formatted resumes, you can find one of those in the header links.)

- Well rounded programmer. Programming professionally since 2010.
- Diverse experience in various domains: most recently, Enterprise GIS (worked on all levels of the stack)
- Love to code, and write software. So much so that I can't wait to retire so that I can code some more.
- Functional Programming Zealot. I chew up OOP design patterns for breakfast and spit out elegant functional equivalents.
- I love Haskell, C++, and Javascript (ES6) - in that order (proficiency in reverse of that order)
- Frameworks/libraries that I reach for immediately are: ReactJS, Redux, Nodejs, Mongodb, and in the C++ side of things - Qt Framework
- My employers generally love me. I love them back. Hugs!
- Highly opinionated. About just about everything. You can read my rants on Software engineering at this site. My political views are on my Facebook page.
- CAN BUILD ANYTHING!!!

### More Information

- Graduated from NIT, Calicut (Kozhikode) in 2008 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering
- Decided I loved computers more that cars by the end of it (I still can't drive!)
